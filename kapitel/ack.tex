\chapter*{Acknowledgement}
I would first like to thank my thesis advisor Marcus Kessel because he was always open whenever I ran into a trouble spot or had a question about this work. He consistently allowed this paper to be my own work, but steered me in the right direction whenever he thought I needed it.

I must express my very profound gratitude to my parents, to my fiance, and to my fiance's family for providing me with unfailing support and continuous encouragement through the years of study and throughout the process of researching and writing this thesis. This accomplishment would not have been possible without them. 

Thank you all!
