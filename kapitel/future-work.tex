\chapter{Future Work}
\label{future-work}
Although the approach presented in this work seems promising, there are many aspect that can be improved or need to be confirmed.

The current version need to be improved and include more features. 

It is necessary to test the approach in real projects in order to evaluate the usefulness of it. One possibility would be to introduce Simile in small open-source projects that adopt test-driven development and some CI server. Another alternative would be to adopt the tool into a company and measure the times inner-developed components are being reused by other development teams of the company.
