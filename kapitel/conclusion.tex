\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}
In this work we have presented a novel approach which is an attempt to improve the chances of reusing software by seizing the continuous integration process. As a proof-of-concept we also presented Simile, which is a tool that analyzes code, extracts interface signatures and test classes, and send them to SOCORA for searching similar components.

We started presenting the foundations of this work. First we talked about the state-of-art of software reuse, its benefits, and challenges. We also explained the different code-search engines in the market focusing on Merobase. Then we defined what ranking components means and we explained the ranking approach SOCORA. Secondly we exposed about continuous integration, its benefits, challenges, and tools. To finalize the foundation chapter we detailed microservices and its characteristics.
