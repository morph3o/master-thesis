\chapter{Conclusion}
In this work we have presented a novel approach which is an attempt to improve software reuse by seizing the continuous integration process. As a proof-of-concept we also presented Simile which is a tool that analyzes code and extracts interface signatures and test classes which are sent to SOCORA to search for similar components. With the result at hand, it delivers the result by email to the developers.
