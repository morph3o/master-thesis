\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}
In this work we have presented a novel approach which is an attempt to improve the chances of reusing software components by seizing continuous integration process. As a proof-of-concept we implemented Simile, which is a service that analyzes code, extracts interface signatures and test classes, and send them to SOCORA for searching similar components. Once SOCORA responses with the components found, this tool sends an email with the details of the candidates to the recipient.

Several benefits come with this approach. Development cost and time development can be reduce by reusing software components, however some human-related challenges might jeopardize these benefits. For instance developers need to be aware of the existence of components that be suitable to its needs. For this reason, the approach presented in this work is a first step to improve the success of software reuse practice in a project. This is due to the fact that Simile is able to work in parallel of the software development process, thus it is able to recommend components with almost no effort from the developers to find and evaluate candidate reusable components. Moreover, by using test-driven search and SOCORA ranking, this tool can recommend components that fully meet the functional requirements ranked based on non-functional requirements.

Despite the fact that this approach is a contribution, it is still immature and needs further improvements. First, our proof-of-concept supports only Jenkins, so other popular CI servers should be supported in the future. Second, supporting the selection of other non-functional requirements by the user is need to be implemented. Third, test-driven search approach necessitates further refinements to improve the time taken to return a result. Finally, SOCORA is a on-going project that will be improved in future version by supporting more features which will improve the outcomes presented in this document.
