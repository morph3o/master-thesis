\chapter{Abstract}
On the one hand there is the Douglas McIlroy's vision \cite{McIlroy1968} of a software system composed of already existent components, where one basically puts different already existent components together in order to form the system is being built. Although the IT industry has tried for many years to improve the speed and reduce cots of software development by reusing components, this vision is still the exception rather than the rule. On the other hand there is Continuous Integration which is a software development practice where members of a team integrate their work frequently. Usually each person integrates at least once a day, thus leading to multiple integrations per day. Each integration is verified by an automated build (including tests) to detect integration errors as quickly as possible. In this work we present a novel approach that improve the reuse of software by seizing the continuous integration process. Also we present an unobtrusive tool as a proof-of-concept that extracts interface signatures and test classes from a given project, which are sent to a code-search engine to retrieve similar components based on text-driven and test-driven search techniques. Finally the result is sent by email to the user.
